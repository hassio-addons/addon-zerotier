# Home Assistant Community Add-on: ZeroTier One

ZeroTier delivers the capabilities of VPNs, SDN, and SD-WAN with a single
system. Manage all your connected resources across both local and wide area
networks as if the whole world is a single data center.

People use ZeroTier to seamlessly connect laptops, desktops, phones,
embedded devices, cloud resources, and apps any way they want anywhere they go.
It transforms the entire world into a single data center, to which you
can now add your Home Assistant instance using this add-on.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "ZeroTier One" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store
   and install it.
1. Create a free account at [zerotier.com][zerotier] and get a network ID.
1. Set the "network_id" add-on option with your network ID.
1. Start the "ZeroTier One" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "ZeroTier One" add-on to see if everything went well.
1. The instance will show up in your ZeroTier account.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
networks:
  - wgfyiwe73747457
  - fhu3888892jjfdk
api_auth_token: ""
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `networks`

Configures one or more network identifiers of the networks (VLAN) to join.
You can find this number in your ZeroTier account.

**Note**: _This option support secrets, e.g., `!secret zerotier_network_id`._

### Option: `api_auth_token`

ZeroTier exposes a local HTTP JSON API, which uses the port set using the
`port` option above. It allows tools and programs to access this ZeroTier
instance for quering data (or control it).

This token is like a password for accessing that API, you can leave this
option empty if you are not planning on using this feature.

For more information on the ZeroTier JSON API, [check their documentation][api].

**Note**: _This option support secrets, e.g., `!secret zerotier_token`._
